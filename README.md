## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - JS Superset
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I always was a bit lazy about learning responsiveness, and that's why I took this project. I could learn a bit about it, and now I feel more confident building responsive pages.

And actually using media queries can be a lot of fun! It's really cool to see responsiveness working across all screens.

### Continued development

I will probably continue to study more about this, as well as good practices in building responsive screens.
